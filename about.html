    <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Hi All! I'm Erin and I am a Project Director at a research institute in Boston. I am lead of Systems Integration for our project management system, Smartsheet, as well as our website. My role involves helping with the design and maintenance of our website. We have a web dev team we work with, but I started taking this course because I felt so eager to build on my own and understand how to make a website look the way I envision it. Learning to code has not been a burden on top of work, it has been such fun to think, build, and create!</p>

        <p>I live with my fiance right outside Boston. We love to cook, garden, ski, and golf. We have a mini goldendoodle, Stanley, that we call noodle.</p>
